This program implements a simple user credentials management system with three classes: UserCredentialsManager, CredentialsChecker, 
and CredentialsGenerator. The UserCredentialsManager class handles the saving, checking, and generating of user credentials(username and password). 
The CredentialsChecker class checks the validity of user inputs based on specified requirments, and the CredentialsGenerator class generates 
random usernames and passwords. The main function allows users to interactively choose between three options: saving credentials, checking 
credentials(validate password), or generating credentials. The program prompts users for input, validates it according to defined rules, and 
provides corresponding outputs. The saved credentials are stored in memory and can be displayed upon user request.
